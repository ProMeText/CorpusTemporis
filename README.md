# 📜 Medieval Multilingual Corpus App

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a **web-based application form** created for the [Multilingual Corpus](https://github.com/ProMeText/Aquilign/tree/main/data/multiling_data) of the [AQUILIGN — Multilingual Aligner and Collator](https://github.com/ProMeText/Aquilign) project.

The application was built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to facilitate the structured collection, organization, and storage of textual data for historical and linguistic research.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The primary goal of this application is to **streamline the collection process** of historical multilingual texts by allowing users to insert, organize, and store textual data in a structured format.

This tool ensures that all textual sources are **well-documented, traceable, and accessible** for further analysis. It provides an interface for submitting texts, viewing statistical insights, and managing stored records.

### Why This Corpus?

This dataset is intended for **training machine learning models for text segmentation**—a key task in breaking down texts into meaningful linguistic units. This work is crucial for improving **text accessibility and analysis, particularly for historical documents.**

The corpus primarily consists of **prose texts from the 13th to 15th centuries**, with the possibility of extending into the mid-16th century. Texts have been selected based on **thematic diversity** to create a **rich dataset** for model training and research purposes.
