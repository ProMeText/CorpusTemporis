# 📜 Corpus Temporis

> *An app for multilingual medieval corpora across time.*  
> *Building temporal bridges through medieval texts.*



## Overview

This repository contains the code for a **web-based application form** created for building and structuring the [Multilingual Segmentation Dataset](https://github.com/ProMeText/Aquilign/tree/main/data/multiling_data) of the [AQUILIGN — Multilingual Aligner and Collator](https://github.com/ProMeText/Aquilign) project.

The application was built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to facilitate the structured collection, organization, and storage of textual data for historical and linguistic research.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The primary goal of this application is to **streamline the collection process** of historical multilingual texts by allowing users to insert, organize, and store textual data in a structured format.

This tool ensures that all textual sources are **well-documented, traceable, and accessible** for further analysis. It provides an interface for submitting texts, viewing statistical insights, and managing stored records.

📌 **Links:**
- [Application Form]() (Currently private)
- [Compiled Data CSV](https://github.com/ProMeText/mulada/blob/main/data.csv)

### Why This Corpus?

This dataset is intended for **training machine learning models for text segmentation**—a key task in breaking down texts into meaningful linguistic units. This work is crucial for improving **text accessibility and analysis, particularly for historical documents.**

The corpus primarily consists of **prose texts from the 13th to 15th centuries**, with the possibility of extending into the mid-16th century. Texts have been selected based on **thematic diversity** to create a **rich dataset** for model training and research purposes. For further information see the related repo [Multilingual segmentation Dataset](https://github.com/ProMeText/multilingual-segmentation-dataset).

## 📌 Features: Corpus Temporis App

| Page          | Icon | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| **App**       | 📝   | Main form for text submission. Input metadata, upload TXT/XML, fill required fields (`*`). |
| **Display TXT** | 📄 | View XML files and convert them into plain text for easier readability. |
| **Stats**     | 📊   | Automatic statistics on the submitted corpus. Analyze trends, distributions, and features. |
| **Texts**     | 📚   | Manage the corpus: search entries, download as CSV, edit or delete texts. |

>Further documentation is available in [**docs/features.md**](./docs/features.md).

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ProMeText/CorpusTemporis.git
   cd CorpusTemporis

2. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the Streamlit App**
   ```bash
    streamlit run app.py

4. **Access the Application** 
    - Once you run the command, Streamlit will usually **open a new tab in your default browser automatically**.  
    If it doesn’t, you can manually navigate to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).

## 👥 Collaborative Workflow 

The **Corpus Temporis dataset (`data.csv`)** is a shared resource collaboratively maintained by the **ProMeText team**.  
To ensure consistency and data integrity, please follow these rules:

### 🔒 Access Policy
- Only the **ProMeText core team** has direct write access to the repository and can push changes to `data.csv`.
- External contributors are welcome to propose improvements, but cannot modify the dataset directly.

### 📝 How to Contribute New Data
If you would like to add new texts, annotations, or corrections:

1. Open a **GitHub Issue** describing your contribution.  
   - Use the label `contribution` when possible.  
   - Clearly state the type of data (text, metadata, segmentation, etc.).  
2. Optionally, you can fork the repository and prepare a **pull request** with your proposed changes.  
   - Please do **not** commit directly to `data.csv`.  
   - Instead, add your data in a separate file (e.g., `data_new.csv`) or attach it to the issue/PR.  
3. The ProMeText team will review, integrate, and validate your contribution into the main `data.csv`.

### 🛠️ Local Workflow for Team Members
For **ProMeText team members**:

1. Always **pull the latest changes** before editing the dataset:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
    ```
2. Run the application locally:
  ```bash
  streamlit run app.py
  ```
3. After making changes, commit and push:
```bash
  git add data.csv
  git commit -m "Update dataset: [short description]"
  git push origin main
  ```
4. If you encounter conflicts in data.csv, resolve them manually before pushing.

## 🤝 Contributing
